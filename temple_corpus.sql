(1, 'SRI ULAGALANTHA PERUMAL TEMPLE', 'Vishnu', 'Ulagalandha Perumal Temple is a temple dedicated to Vishnu located in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, India. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th through 9th centuries CE. It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Ulagalantha Perumal, and his consort Lakshmi as Amuthavalli. The temple is believed to have been built by the Pallavas, with later contributions from the medieval Cholas, Vijayanagara kings, and Madurai Nayaks.\nThe temple is found in Big Kanchipuram, and situated close Kamakshi Amman Temple. The temple complex actually houses four Divya Desams in its different precincts, namely, Tirukkaravanam, Tirukarakam, Tiruneerakam, and Tiruürakam, that last of which is present with in the sanctum sanctorum of the main temple.\nVamana, the Brahmin dwarf, and one of the ten avatars of Vishnu, is held to have appeared here to quell the pride of the asura king Mahabali. As Ulagalantha Perumal, he is believed to have appeared before king Mahabali and the Alvars. Six daily rituals and a dozen yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the chariot festival, celebrated during the Tamil month of Chittirai (March–April), is the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nThe Bhagavata Purana describes that Vishnu descended as the Vamana avatar to restore the authority of Indra over Svarga, as it had been taken by Mahabali, a benevolent asura King. Bali was the grandson of Prahlada. King Mahabali was generous, and engaged in severe austerities, winning the praise of the world. With the praise from his courtiers and others, he regarded himself as the most powerful being in the world. Vamana, in the guise of a short Brahmin carrying a wooden umbrella, went to the king to request three paces of land. Mahabali consented, against the warning of his guru, Shukracharya. Vamana then revealed his identity, and enlarged to gigantic proportions to stride over the three worlds. He stepped from heaven to earth with the first step, from earth to the netherworld with the second. With all the dominions he held effectively under Vamana\'s strides. King Mahabali, unable to fulfill his promise, offered his head for the third. Vamana then placed his foot upon the humbled monarch, banishing him to the netherworld. Some texts also report that Vamana did not step into the netherworld, and instead gave its rule to Mahabali.\nIn his giant form, Vamana is known as Trivikrama. The legend is associated with the Thrikkakara Temple in Kerala and also with this temple and Ulagalantha Perumal Temple, Tirukoyilur.[1][2][3][4]\nAccording to the historian Nagaswamy, based on the inscriptions and the location of the temple, it is the oldest temple in Kanchipuram.[5] The earliest inscription is from 846 CE during the regime of Nandivarman III (846–869 CE). There is another account that the temple is developed further by Rajendra Chola I (1012–1044 CE).[6] The temple has 15 inscriptions from various dynasties like Pallavas, Chola and Sambuvarayars. There is a Chola inscription dated 1110 CE during the reign of Kulothunga Chola I (1070–1120 CE) indicating his visit to the temple and his gift of land to the temple whose income was to be used for the maintenance of the temple. Another similar inscription indicates the donation of a village by the king on behest of his queen Kampamadeviyar. There are inscriptions from later Chola kings like Rajadhiraja Chola II (1166–1178 CE) and Rajaraja Chola III (1216-1256 CE) indicating various records of gifts to the temple. There are also inscriptions from minor chieftains like Vijaya Gandagopala indicating gifts to the temple.[7] The inscriptions refer the main deity by various names like Thiru Uragathu Ninru-arulina Paramaswamin, Tiru Uragathaḻvar and Tiru Uragathu Emberuman.[7][8] The Sambuvarayar rule of the 16th century records the gift of a pond and a grove in Sevvanmedu village. The temple still continues to possess this grove.[8] The inscriptions in the temple also indicate increased trade and commerce during the Pallava period, with licenses provided to shops like oil, ghee, arecanut, vegetables, flowers, coconut, sugar, cloth and sandal.[9] The temple has not received a single donation from the ruling Vijayanagara Empire, though the nearby temples received generous donations, indicating that the temple had sources of income. From those days Pancharatra Agama was followed in the temple, though all the surrounding people followed Vaikhanasa and Pancharatra Agama.[5]\nParimelalhagar, the 13th-century Tirukkural commentator, belonged to the lineage of priests of the Ulagalantha Perumal temple.[10]\nThe temple is located in central Kanchipuram, a locality in the Central side of Kanchipuram, a South Indian town in the state of Tamil Nadu.[11] The temple has an area of about 60,000 square feet (5,600 m2) and has a three tiered rajagopuram (main towers) with seven kalasas. The temple houses four Divya Desams on its own – they are Tirukkaravanam, Tirukarakam, Tiruürakam, and Tiruneerakam.[12] It is believed that all the shrines were probably separate temples, but the circumstances which lead do these temples getting housed in the Ulagalantha Perumal temple is not known.[13] Thirumangai Alvar has sung praises of all the four temples in a single verse. The temple tank, Naga Tirtham, is located outside the main temple complex.[14]\nThe temple is revered by the verses of Tirumangai Alvar and Thirumaḻisai Alvar. Thaayar of the temple is Amuthavalli (Amirthavalli) and the festival deity of the temple is Loganathan. The image of Ulagalantha Perumal is over 35 ft (11 m) in height depicted with his left leg at a right angle to the body and parallel to the ground. The right leg is seen placed on the head of Mahabali with two fingers on his left hand stretched out referring to the two steps he took to measure the two worlds and the stretched finger on his right hand indicating the question the posted to Mahabali as to where he could place his third step. The roof of the sanctum, the vimana has an elevated roof to accommodate the huge image of the presiding deity.[15]\nThe central shrine of temple is most commonly referred as Peragam, while the smaller shrine where the image of the snake god Adishesha is houses is called Tiruürakam. As per tradition, Mahabali at the foot of Vamana, could not view the deity\'s vishvarupam, and requested him to manifest as a smaller form. Vishnu obliged, and appeared as a snake in a smaller shrine. The shrine is frequented by childless couple praying for offspring.[13][14]\nThe shrine is located on the third precinct of the temple. As per Hindu legend, sage Garga performed his penance at this temple and obtained knowledge. The place thus derived its name Garagaham, which later became Karakam. The presiding deity of the shrine is Karunakara Perumal facing north and seated on Adishesha and his consort Padmamani Nachiyar. The temple tank associated with it is called Agraya Tirtham, and the vimana is called Vamana Vimanam or Ramaya Vimanam.[14][16]\nThe shrine is located in the second precinct. The presiding deity is called Kalvar and faces north, while his consort is Kamalvalli Thayar. Gauri Tatakam and Taratara Tatakam are the temple tanks associated with the temple and the vimana is called Puskala Vimana.[14][17] There is a separate for Aranavalli Thayar.[14]\nThe temple has no presiding deity, but just a festive image probably brought from other shrine. The images of the festival deity, Jagadishvara, facing the east and having four arms, is housed in a hall in the second precinct. The water body associated with the temple is Akrura Tirtham and the vimana is Jagadishvara Vimanam. According to Pillai Perumal Aiyangar in his Nurrettrutiruppatiyantati, Vishnu revealed himself to a sage in the form of a child as a banyan leaf.[14][18]\nThe temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin community. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Ulagalantha Perumal and Amuthavalli. During the last step of worship, nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.[19] There are two major festivals celebrated in the temple - Brahmotsavam during the Tamil month of Thai (January–February) and Vamana Jayanthi during the Tamil month of Avani (August–September) on Sravanam star.[7]\nThe temple is revered in Naalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Thirumangai Alvar in one hymn of Thirunedunthandagam. The temple is classified as a Divya Desam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book.[19] The temple is unique among Divya Desams as it is the only temple complex that houses four different Divya Desams.[8]', 'images/SRI ULAGALANTHA PERUMAL TEMPLE/Ulagalanda-Perumal-Temple-kanchipuram_37049.jpg', 'Periya, Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu 631501, India', 12.838988, 79.704990, 'Opening hours not available', 'To Be Implemented', 'https://translate.google.com/translate?u=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulagalantha_Perumal_Temple,_Kanchipuram', '180042531111, +91180042531111', 'Email not available'),
(2, 'SRI AADHIKESAVA PERUMAL TEMPLE', 'Vishnu', 'The Adikesava Perumal Temple is a Hindu temple located in Thiruvattar, Kanyakumari district, Tamil Nadu, India and is one of the 108 Divya desams, the holy sites of Hindu Vaishnavism according to existing Tamil hymns from the seventh and eighth centuries C.E. The temple is one of the historic thirteen Divya Deshams of Malai Nadu. The temple is a picturesque setting surrounded on three sides by rivers namely, (River Kothai, River Pahrali and River Thamirabarani) It was the Rajya Temple and Bharadevatha shrine of Erstwhile Travancore. After state reorganisation, the temple handed over to Tamilnadu H&RCE Dept. The presiding Vishnu in the form of Ananthapadmabhan/Adikeshavaperumal is believed to be older than Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram. Since Vishnu resides here in a reclining position, and is surrounded by rivers, the temple is called as \"The Srirangam of Chera Kingdom\".\nThe temple  was consecrated by Parasurama and is admired by Veda vyasa in the sections which deal with temples in Padma Purana. As per the stone inscriptions which dates back to 779 KE the temple is established in the Treta yuga. The Adikeshava temple is also where Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, founder of the Gaudiya Vaishnava movement, discovered the lost manuscript of the Brahma Samhita.[citation needed]\nThe temple architecture is Dravidian style architecture with wooden pillars, doors and roofs. The Temple is surrounded by a thirty-feet-high fort wall. The outer corridor stand on 224 stone pillars. The adjacent forward facing mandapams includes sculptures and art works which depicts events from Ramayana. It also portrays Gods and goddesses from Hindu mythology including  Shiva, Parvati and Sri Krishna etc. The lord is lying on his snake couch and has to be viewed through three doors. We could see Lord Shiva near Lord Adikesava Perumal inside the sannidhi. Deepalakshmis are many but none resembles the other. The Otraikkal Mandapam (single stone hall) made of a single stone 3 feet thick, is a marvel. Oorthuva Thandavam, Venugopala, Rathi, Manmatha, Lakshmana and Indrajit are excellently carved. The temple is also renowned for its murals.\nThe composite columns of Virabhadra holding sword and horn are found be additions of the Vijayanagara kings during the early 1500s. Similar columns of Virabhadra are found in Meenakshi Temple at Madurai, Nellaiappar Temple at Tirunelveli, Kasi Viswanathar temple at Tenkasi, Krishnapuram Venkatachalapathy temple, Ramanathaswamy Temple at Rameswaram, Soundararajaperumal temple at Thadikombu, Srivilliputhur Andal temple, Srivaikuntanathan Perumal temple at Srivaikuntam, Avudayarkovil, Vaishnava Nambi and Thirukurungudivalli Nachiar temple at Thirukkurungudi.[1]\nThe temple complex includes a Ayyappan temple behind which stands the Ksetra bala Balikkal. It also includes Sree Bali Prakaram and the Yanaikottil. Other deities being located in the south-western corner, the flagmast is located at the west at the  Sree Balippura. As per the stone inscriptions in the pedestal of the flag mast it was renovated by Sree Moolam Thirunal Rama Varma VI in 1071 KE.  The granite entrance of the Chitra Sabha  includes sculptures of the Dwara Palakas, Jaya and Vijaya. Sculptures of Lakshmana and Pathanjali Tandava carved to the left of Sabha Mandapam while that of Indrajith, Muralidhara and Kalabairava are carved  to the right. The image of the chief deity in his sayana posture, is sculpted on the wooden entrance door. Vatteluttu incriptions of Shilpa Shastra are found in adjacent walls. It also includes details about the 11th century Chola King Rajendra Chola.\nSculptures  of Rati and Manmadan is found opposite Udaya Marthanda Mandapam.  The epic scenes Vinayaka Kalyanam, Bharata War and deities Varuna, Niriyati, Yama, Kubera, Indra, Agni, Brahma and Monks in penance are sculpted in a row above the Mandapam. A variety of mural painting are found along the walls of the inner prakarams. A secret passage leading to the Palace is found beneath the west of the inner prakarams which is covered with a large stone slab.\nGoing by extant legends, the temple is closely associated with the famous Sree Anantha Padmanabhaswamy Temple, Thiruvananthapuram. Thiruvananthapuram Sri Anantha Padmanabhaswamy temple deity lies in the direction as to see the Thiruvattar Adi kesava deity. The main deity was originally covered with gold kavachams in which diamonds and other precious stones were embedded which the Kerala kings had presented to the temple. There is also a small shrine for Lord Lakshmi Narasimhaswamy near the river and opposite to the Adikesava Perumal Temple. Alvar saint Nammalvar had sung 11 pasurams in praise of Adi Kesava Swamy in the 6th Thiruvai mozhi. There are Three temples related to Adikesava Perumal Temple. It is believed that, the Moolasthanam of all three temples such as Padmanabhaswamy temple, Thiruvananthapuram; Adikesava Perumal Temple, Thiruvattar and Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple, Srirangam is Ananthapadmanabhaswamy Temple or Anantha Lake Temple near Kumbla in Manjeshwaram Taluk of Kasaragod District of Kerala, South India.\nThe entire present day Kanyakumari District formed part of erstwhile Travancore Kingdom. Up to Marthanda Varma, all kings ruled the erstwhile Venad Kingdom (which was expanded by Marthanda Varma to form Thiruvithaamkoor) from Padmanabhapuram in Kanyakumari District. It was Dharma Raja, the nephew and successor of Marthanda Varma, who shifted the capital to Thiruvananthapuram. Padmanabhapuram Palace, the erstwhile royal abode of Travancore Kings, is still preserved in all its glory and is situated at Padmanabhapuram in Kalkulam Taluk of Kanyakumari District. Marthanda Varma was a staunch devotee of Lord Adikesava and used to worship at the temple before all the major war campaigns undertaken by him.\nThe presiding Deities of Thiruvattar, Thiruvananthapuram and Thiruvalla had a three-cornered connection which reflects in the quantitative measurement of commodities utilised etc.\nThe Perumals of Thiruvattar and Thiruvananthapuram remain closely bound to each other with this closeness being mirrored not only in festivals which coincide, special days and many rituals but also in the structural pattern including the Ottakkal Mandapam. In both cases the Moola Vigrahas are of Katu-Sarkara and are containing Salagramas. The strong affiliation of the Venad kings to both Thiruvattar and Thiruvananthapuram temples in their privileges and responsibilities provide ample evidence of enduring interconnections. Many ceremonies had to be initially performed at Sree AdiKesava Temple before being conducted at the Padmanabha Swamy Temple.\nThe Lord AdiKesavaSwamy means \'Foremost Friend\'. Legend says that Lord AdiKesavaSwamy defeated the demon Kesi. The demon\'s wife prayed to the River Ganges and to River Thamirabarani and created a destruction. But it was in vain and she surrendered to the Lord. Thus, the formation of the rivers made in a circle came to be known as Thiruvattaru.[2]\nOn 10 June 1741, Anizham Tirunal Marthanda Varma, the then ruler of Travancore, before going for the Battle of Colachel offered 908 panams, yataghan, and silk on the feet of Lord Adikesava and prayed for victory.\nVaikunta Ekadesi is celebrated with pomp and glory. Paal Payasam (Milk Kheer), Aval and Appam are delicious prasadams at this temple. The pujas are done in the same manner as that of the Sri Padmanabhaswamy temple, Thiruvananthapuram.', 'images/SRI AADHIKESAVA PERUMAL TEMPLE/500px-Adikesaa_%284%29_61462.jpg', 'Vedachalam Nagar Extension, Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu 631502, India', 12.818456, 79.694659, 'Opening hours not available', 'To Be Implemented', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adikesava_Perumal_Temple,_Kanyakumari', 'Phone number not available ,International phone number not available', 'Email not available'),
(3, 'Kedarnath Temple', 'Shiva', 'Saiddhantika\nNon - Saiddhantika\nKedarnath Temple (Sanskrit: केदारनाथ मंदिर, IAST: Kēdāranātha Mandira, lit. \'temple of the God of the field\') is a Hindu temple, one of the twelve jyotirlinga of Shiva. The temple is located on the Garhwal Himalayan range[citation needed] \nnear the Mandakini river, in the state of Uttarakhand, India. Due to extreme weather conditions, the temple is open to the general public only between the months of April (Akshaya Tritiya) and November (Kartik Purnima, the autumn full moon). During the winters, the vigraha (deity) of the temple is carried down to Ukhimath to be worshipped for the next six months. Kedarnath is seen as a homogeneous form of Shiva, the \'Lord of Kedarkhand\', the historical name of the region.[1]\nThe temple is not directly accessible by road and has to be reached by a 22 kilometres (14 mi) uphill trek from Gaurikund. Pony, mule and manchan service is available to reach the temple. According to Hindu legends, the temple was initially built by the Pandavas, and is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas, the holiest Hindu shrines of Shiva.[2] The Pandavas were supposed to have pleased Shiva by doing penance in Kedarnath.[3][2] The temple is one of the four major sites in India\'s Chota Char Dham pilgrimage of Northern Himalayas and is the first of the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites. This temple is the highest among the 12 Jyotirlingas.[4] It is one of the 275 paadal petra sthalams expounded in the Tevaram, a sacred Tamil Shaivite text written during the 6th and 7th centuries by 63 saints called Nayanars. This temple is sung of by Thirugnanasambandar, Appar, Sundarar and Sekkizhar in their Tevaram texts.[5]\nKedarnath was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods in North India. The temple complex, surrounding areas, and Kedarnath town suffered extensive damage, but the temple structure did not suffer any major damage, apart from a few cracks on one side of the four walls which was caused by the flowing debris from the higher mountains. A large rock among the debris acted as a barrier, protecting the temple from the flood. The surrounding premises and other buildings in the market area were heavily damaged.[6]\nAt a height of 3,583 m (11,755 ft), 223 km (139 mi) from Rishikesh, on the shores of Mandakini river, a tributary of Ganga, is a stone edifice of unknown date.[7] It is not certain who built the original Kedarnath temple and when. The name \"Kedarnath\" means \"the lord of the field\": it derives from the Sanskrit words kedara (\"field\") and natha (\"lord\"). The text Kashi Kedara Mahatmya states that it is so called because \"the crop of liberation\" grows here.[8]\nMany folk legends related to the Garhwal region, Lord Shiva and the creation of the Panch Kedar temples are narrated.\nA folk legend about Panch Kedar relates to the Pandavas, the heroes of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The Pandavas defeated and slew their cousins — the Kauravas in the epic Kurukshetra war. They wished to atone for the sins of committing fratricide (gotra hatya) and Brāhmanahatya (killing of Brahmins — the priest class) during the war. Thus, they handed over the reins of their kingdom to their kin and left in search of the lord Shiva and to seek his blessings. First, they went to the holy city of Varanasi (Kashi), believed to be Shiva\'s favourite city and known for its Kashi Vishwanath Temple. But, Shiva wanted to avoid them as he was deeply incensed by the death and dishonesty at the Kurukshetra war and was, therefore, insensitive to Pandavas\' prayers. Therefore, he assumed the form of a bull (Nandi) and hid in the Garhwal region.\nNot finding Shiva in Varanasi, the Pandavas went to Garhwal Himalayas. Bhima, the second of the five Pandava brothers, then standing astride two mountains started to look for Shiva. He saw a bull grazing near Guptakashi (\"hidden Kashi\" — the name derived from the hiding act of Shiva). Bhima immediately recognized the bull to be Shiva. Bhima caught hold of the bull by its tail and hind legs. But the bull-formed Shiva disappeared into the ground to later reappear in parts, with the hump raising in Kedarnath, the arms appearing in Tungnath, the face showing up at Rudranath, the nabhi (navel) and stomach surfacing in Madhyamaheshwar and the hair appearing in Kalpeshwar. The Pandavas pleased with this reappearance in five different forms, built temples at the five places for venerating and worshipping Shiva.[9][10]\nA variant of the tale credits Bhima for not only catching the bull but also stopping it from disappearing. Consequently, the bull was torn asunder into five parts and appeared at five locations in the Kedar Khand of Garhwal region of the Himalayas.[9] After building the Panch Kedar Temples, the Pandavas meditated at Kedarnath for salvation, performed yagna (fire sacrifice) and then through the heavenly path called the Mahapanth (also called Swargarohini), attained heaven or salvation. The Panch Kedar Temples are constructed in the North-Indian Himalayan Temple architecture with the Kedarnath, Tungnath and Madhyamaheshwar temples looking similar.[11]\nAfter completing the pilgrimage of Lord Shiva\'s darshan at the Panch Kedar Temples, it is an unwritten religious rite to visit Lord Vishnu at the Badrinath Temple, as a final affirmatory proof by the devotee that he has sought blessings of Lord Shiva.[12]\nThe Mahabharata, which gives the account of the Pandavas and the Kurukshetra War, does not mention any place called Kedarnath. One of the earliest references to Kedarnath occurs in the Skanda Purana (c. 7th-8th century), which contains a story describing the origin of the Ganges river. The text names Kedara (Kedarnath) as the place where Shiva released the holy water from his matted hair.[13]\nAccording to the hagiographies based on Madhava\'s Sankshepa-shankara-vijaya, the 8th century philosopher Adi Shankara died at the mountains near Kedarnath; although other hagiographies, based on Anandagiri\'s Prachina-Shankara-Vijaya, state that he died at Kanchipuram. The ruins of a monument marking the purported death place of Shankara are located at Kedarnath.[14] Kedarnath was definitely a prominent pilgrimage centre by the 12th century, when it is mentioned in Kritya-kalpataru written by the Gahadavala minister Bhatta Lakshmidhara.[15]\nKedarnath Teerth Purohits are the ancient Brahmins of this region, their ancestors (Rishi-Muni) have been worshiping the lingam since the time of Nara-Narayana and Daksh Prajapati. King Janmejay, grandson of the Pandavas, gave them the right of worshiping this temple and donate the whole Kedar region, and they have been worshiping pilgrims ever since.[8][13][14]\nAccording to a tradition recorded by the English mountaineer Eric Shipton (1926), \"many hundreds of years ago\" one priest used to hold services at both the Kedarnath and Badrinath temples, travelling between the two places daily.[16]\nThe presiding image of Kedarnath in the form of lingam is of irregular shape with a pedestal 3.6 m (12 ft) in circumference and 3.6 m (12 ft) in height. There is a small pillared hall in front of the temple, that has images of Parvati and of the five Pandava princes. There are four temples around Kedarnath itself, namely- Tungnath, Rudranath, Madhyamaheshwar, and Kalpeshwar which form the Panch Kedar pilgrimage sites.[17] The first hall inside Kedarnath Temple contains statues of the five Pandava brothers, Krishna, Nandi, the vehicle of Shiva and Virabhadra, one of the guards of Shiva. Statues of Draupadi and other deities are also installed in the main hall.[1] An unusual feature of the temple is the head of a man carved in the triangular stone lingam. Such a head is seen carved in another temple nearby constructed on the site where the marriage of Shiva and Parvati was held. Adi Shankara was believed to have revived this temple, along with Badrinath and other temples of Uttarakhand; he is believed to have attained Mahasamadhi at Kedarnath. Behind the temple is the samādhi mandir of Adi Sankara.[18]\nThe head priest (Raval) of the Kedarnath temple belongs to the Veerashaiva community from Karnataka.[19] However, unlike in Badrinath temple, the Raval of Kedarnath temple does not perform the pujas. The pujas are carried out by Raval\'s assistants on his instructions. The Raval moves with the deity to Ukhimath during the winter season. There are five main priests for the temple, and they become head priests for one year by rotation. The present (2013) Raval of Kedarnath temple is Shri Vageesha Lingacharya from Davanagere district, Karnataka.[19] Surrounding Kedarnath, there are many symbols of the Pandavas. Raja Pandu died at Pandukeshwar. The tribals here perform a dance called \"Pandav Lila\".[20] The mountain top where the Pandavas went to Swarga, is known as \"Swargarohini\", which is located off Badrinath. When Yudhishtira, the eldest of the Pandavas, was leaving for the heaven, one of his fingers fell on the earth. At that place, Yudhishtira installed a Shiva Linga, which is the size of the thumb. To gain Mashisharupa, Lord Shiva and Bheema fought with maces. Bheema was struck with remorse. He started to massage Shiva\'s body with ghee. In memory of this event, even today, this triangular Shiva lingam is massaged with ghee. Water and bilva-patra leaves are used for worship.\nThe temple was included in the Uttar Pradesh State Government Act No. 30/1948 as Act no. 16,1939, which came to be known as Shri Badarinath and Shri Kedarnath Mandir Act. The committee nominated by the state government administers both temples. The act was modified in 2002 by the Uttarakhand State Government, which provisioned adding additional committee members including government officials and a vice-chairman.[21] There are a total of seventeen members in the board; three selected by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly, one member each selected by the District Councils of Chamoli, Pauri Garhwal, Tehri Garhwal and Uttarkashi districts, and ten members nominated by the Government of Uttarakhand.[22] On the religious side, there is a Rawal (chief priest) and three other priests: Naib Rawal, Acharya/Dharmadhikari and Vedpathi.[23] The administrative structure of the temple consists of a chief executive officer who executes the orders from the state government. A deputy chief executive officer, two OSDs, an executive officer, an account officer, a temple officer, and a publicity officer assist the chief executive officer.[24]\nNearest Airport: Dehradun\nNearest Railway Station: Rishikesh\nThe Kedarnath valley, along with other parts of the state of Uttarakhand, was hit with unprecedented flash floods on 16 and 17 June 2013. On 16 June, at about 7:30 p.m. a landslide and mudslides occurred near Kedarnath Temple with loud peals of thunder. An enormously loud peal was heard and huge amounts of water started gushing from Chorabari Tal or Gandhi Tal down Mandakini river at about 8:30 p.m. washing everything away in its path. On 17 June 2013 at about 6:40 a.m. waters again started cascading at a huge speed from river Swaraswati and Chorabari Tal or Gandhi Tal bringing along with its flow huge amount of silt, rocks, and boulders. A huge rock got stuck behind Kedarnath Temple and protected it from the ravages of the flood. The waters gushed on both the sides of the temple destroying everything in their path. Even eyewitness observed that one large rock got carried to the rear side of Kedarnath Temple, thus causing obstruction to the debris, diverting the flow of river and debris to the sides of the temple avoiding damage. The rock which protected the temple is worshipped as the God\'s Rock (भीम शीला).\nAnother theory for the temple not being destroyed is because of its construction.[25][26][27][28] Although the temple withstood the severity of the floods, the complex and surrounding area were destroyed, resulting in the death of hundreds of pilgrims and locals. Shops and hotels in Kedarnath were destroyed and all roads were broken. People took shelter inside the temple for several hours, until the Indian Army airlifted them to safer places.[19] The Uttarakhand Chief Minister announced that the Kedarnath shrine would remain closed for a year for clearing the debris.\nThe experts, who were asked by the Archaeological Survey of India to examine the condition of the foundation in wake of the floods have arrived at the conclusion that there was no danger to the temple. The IIT Madras experts visited the temple thrice for the purpose. Non-destructive testing instruments that do not disturb the structure of the temple were used by the IIT-team for assessing the health of the structure, foundation, and walls. They have submitted their interim report that the temple is stable and there was no major danger.[29][30]\nNehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM) was given the responsibility of rebuilding Kedarnath. Although the institute did not have the expertise in urban planning or construction, they mastered in high altitude training. Under the leadership of veteran mountaineer, Colonel Ajay Kothiyal, NIM rigorously worked for a year and made the pilgrimage yatra possible from the next year.[31]', 'images/Kedarnath Temple/574px-Kedarnath_Temple_102833.jpg', 'Kedarnath, Uttarakhand 246445, India', 30.735231, 79.066895, 'Monday\n0400–2100\n\nTuesday\n0400–2100\n\nWednesday\n0400–2100\n\nThursday\n0400–2100\n\nFriday\n0400–2100\n\nSaturday\n0400–2100\n\nSunday\n0400–2100', 'To Be Implemented', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kedarnath_Temple', '01389222083, +911389222083', 'Email not available'),
(4, 'SRI YATHOTHAKAARI PERUMAL TEMPLE', 'Shiva', 'Tiruvekkaa Temple or Yathothkari Perumal Temple (locally called Sonnavannam Seitha Perumall) is a Hindu temple located in Kanchipuram in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu and dedicated to the Hindu god Vishnu. Constructed in the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is glorified in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham, the early medieval Tamil canon of the Alvar saints from the 6th–9th centuries CE. It is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Yathothkari Perumal, and his consort Lakshmi as Komalavalli.\nThe temple is considered one of three oldest Vishnu temples in Kanchipuram, the other two being Ulagalantha Perumal Temple and Pandava Thoothar Perumal Temple. The temple is believed to have been built by the Pallavas of the late 8th century CE, with later contributions from Medieval Cholas and Vijayanagara kings. The temple has three inscriptions on its walls, two dating from the period of Kulothunga Chola I (1070–1120 CE) and one to that of Rajadhiraja Chola (1018-54 CE). A granite wall surrounds the temple, enclosing all the shrines. There is a three-tiered rajagopuram, the temple\'s gateway tower, in the temple.\nYathothkari Perumal is believed to have appeared for Saraswati and Thirumalisai Alvar. Six daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple. The temple houses a rare image of Ranganatha recumbent on his left hand unlike other temples where he is recumbent on his right. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nPoigai Alvar, one of the Alvars, was born at this temple\'s lotus tank. Panguni Brahmotsavam celebrated during April - May and Poigai Alvar birthday during Aipassi Thiruvonam star are the two major festivals celebrated in the temple.\nAs per Hindu legend, once there was an argument between Saraswati, the consort of Brahma and Lakshmi on superiority. They went to Indra, the king of celestial deities. Indra judged Lakshmi as superior and not satisfied with his argument, Saraswati went to her husband, Brahma. He also chose Lakshmi to be the superior one. Saraswati was unhappy with the decision and decided to stay away from Brahma. Brahma did a severe penance praying to Vishnu and did an ashvamedha yagna. Saraswati was still angry that the yagna, which usually is done along with consorts was done alone by Brahma. She tried to disrupt the penance, but Vishnu interfered with his serpent Adishesha. Saraswati, on seeing Vishnu in her path, accepted her defeat and subsided in the form of river Vegavathi. As Vishnu interfered the path of the river, it was termed Vegavani, then as Vegannai and gradually corrupted to Vekka. The presiding deity thus got one of his names, Vegasetu.[1][2][3] As per historian Nagaswamy, the temple was called Vehha meaning Vishnu leaning as a slanted slope, which gradually became vekka.[4]\nOnce sage Bhargava had a son through Kanakangi, a celestial dancer. The boy was stillborn and was not fully developed during his birth. Kanakangi left his son under bushes and left to celestial world. It is believed that the child was a divine incarnation of one of Vishnu\'s weapons, the Chakra. By the grace of Vishnu and Lakshmi, the baby became alright and began to cry. A childless farmer couple who were passing by took up the child, named him Sivavakkiyar and started rearing him. Once the boy reached adulthood, he was sceptical about choosing between Shaivism and Vaishnavism. He was defeated in arguments by Pey Alvar. He became a devotee of Vaishnavism and the disciple of Pey Alvar. Sivavakkiyar was also called Bhakthisarar and later as Thirumalisai Alvar.[1][2]\nThirumalisai had a disciple by name Kanikkannan. He also had an old lady serving him - Thirumalisai prayed to the presiding deity of the temple and by the grace of Bhujangasayana Perumal, the old lady became a beautiful young lady. The Pallava king who was ruling the region at that time got attracted by the lady and married her. With time while the king was growing older, the lady remained young. He called up Kanikannan and ordered to sing praise of him so that he also turned young. When he refused, the king ordered Kanikannan to be banished out of the country. Kanikannan explained this to his master Thirumalisai, who prayed to Bhujangasayana Perumal. When the king heard this, he ordered the three to be sent of the country, which they obliged. When the three left Kanchipuram, it was engulfed in darkness. Realising his sin, the king worshipped Bhujangasayana Perumal to return along with his two devotees. Since the presiding deity obliged to his devotees wishes, he is called Yathothkari Perumal. Yathothka means as requested and kari denotes the person who accomplishes the task.[1][2] One of the Alvars, poet saints of 7-10th century, Poigai Alvar was born at this temple.[5]\nThe temple is considered one of three oldest Vishnu temples in Kanchipuram, the other two being Ulagalantha Perumal Temple and Pandava Thoothar Perumal Temple.[6] The temple has 12 inscriptions from the Chola and Vijayanagara period.[7] The temple finds a mention in the Sangam text Perumpāṇāṟṟuppaṭai.[8]  The temple is originally believed to be built during the period of Pallavas. The temple has a set of inscriptions associated with Cholas. A record of the Chola king, Parantaka I (907–950 CE) indicating gift of 367 kalanju of gold to the temple by an individual .  The south wall of the central shrine of the temple has inscriptions from the period Rajendra Chola I (1012–44) indicating gifts of land measuring to one tuni of land and 127 kalanju of gold to the temple. The inscriptions on the base of the eastern wall of the central shrine from the period of Kulothunga Chola I (1070–1120 CE) indicating gift for lighting lamps of the temple. The southern side inscriptions of the temple from the period of Kulothunga Chola III (1178–1218 CE) indicates a gift of village to feed 32 Brahmins.[1] The inscriptions also detail the float festival and the summer festival celebrated in the temple.[7] The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nThe temple in Chinna Kanchipuram, a locality in the Eastern side of Kanchipuram, a South Indiann town in the state of Tamil Nadu.[9] The central shrine of the temple has the image of presiding deity, \"Sonnavannam Seitha Perumal\" sported in Bhuganja Sayanam posture. The West facing sanctum is approached through the flagstaff, pillared halls, namely Mahamandapam and the Ardhamandapam. The stucco image of the presiding deity is a rare one of Ranganatha recumbent on his left hand unlike other temples where he is recumbent on his right. It is believed that Perumal was lying left to right as in other temples, but on hearing Thirumalisai Alvar sing, he turned his lying posture from right to left.[10] As per historian Nagaswamy, the image made of stucco, is one of the rarest representation of the deity.[4] The image of Saraswati praying at his feet is also present in the sanctum. The roof of the sanctum is called Vedasara Vimana and it has five kalasams and stucco images of various legend. The temple has separate shrines for Poigai Alvar located to the North of the flagstaff. There are other shrines of Rama along with Seetha and Hanuman and Garuda. The vimana of the central shrine is called Vedasara Vimana. The shrine of Komavalli, the consort of Yathothkari, is located facing the central shrine in the Eastern side of the temple. The temple lotus tank where Poigai Alvar was born is located outside the main entrance, parallel to the shrine. The Mahamandapa has ornamental sculpted pillars built during the Vijayanagara period of 15-16th centuries.[7] The temple has two precincts with the second precinct enclosed by granite walls pierced by a five tiered rajagopuram (gateway tower).[11]\nThe temple follows the traditions of the Thenkalai sect of Vaishnavite tradition and follows vaikanasa aagama. The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed six times a day: Ushathkalam at 7 a.m., Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., Irandamkalam at 7:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Yathothkari Perumal and Komalavalli.[12] During the last step of worship, nadaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument) are played, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.[10] Aipassi Thiruvonam, the birth star of Poigai Alvar, is celebrated every year. Brahmotsavam celebrated during the Tamil month of Panguni (April - May) is the major festival of the temple.[11] To indicate the legend of Kanikannan, the festive image of Yathothkari, Tirumalisai Alvar and Kanikkannan are taken in procession to Orikkai village to have a short stay during the Thai Magam festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Thai (January - February).[7] Alvar Utsavam is a festival celebrated annually during the birth date of the Poigai Alvar based on Tamil calendar in the temple.[13]\nThe temple finds mention in Perumpaanatrupadai written by Patanjali. There is a mention about the temple in Silappatikaram (2nd-3rd century CE), Patanjali Mahabharatham and Tolkāppiyam (3rd century BCE). The temple is revered in Nalayira Divya Prabandham, the 7th–9th century Vaishnava canon, by Poigai Alvar, Peyalvar, Bhoothathalvar and Thirumalisai Avar. The Alvars have sung praise on the different forms of Yathothkari Peruamal. The temple is classified as a Divya Desam, one of the 108 Vishnu temples that are mentioned in the book. Many acharyas have also written songs on the various forms of God in this Temple.[1]\nThe temple is considered the birthplace of Poigai Alvar, one of the first three Alvar saints. He was found in a small pond (called Poigai in Tamil) near the temple. The temple and the pond are thus considered holy as it is the birthplace of the saint.[14][15][16]', 'images/SRI YATHOTHAKAARI PERUMAL TEMPLE/440px-Yathothkari_%289%29_88935.jpg', 'Empty address', 0.000000, 0.000000, 'Empty Hours', 'To Be Implemented', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yathothkari_Perumal_Temple', '180042531111, +91180042531111', 'Empty Email');

(5, 'SRI VARADARAJA PERUMAL TEMPLE', 'Shiva', 'Varadharaja Perumal Temple, also called Hastagiri and Attiyuran, is a Hindu temple dedicated to Vishnu located in the city of Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the Divya Desams, the 108 temples of Vishnu believed to have been visited by the 12 poet saints, or the Alvars.[1] It is located in a suburb of Kanchipuram known as the Vishnu Kanchi that is a home for many famous Vishnu temples. One of the greatest Hindu scholars of Vaishnava Vishishtadvaita philosophy, Ramanuja, is believed to have resided in this temple.[2]\nThe temple along with Ekambareswarar Temple and Kamakshi Amman Temple in Kanchipuram is popularly known as  Mumurtivasam (abode of trio),[3] while Srirangam is referred to as: \'Koil\' (meaning: \"temple\") and Tirupati as: \'Malai\' (Meaning: \"hill\"). Among the Divya Desams, Kanchipuram Varadharaja Perumal temple is known as: \'Perumal Koil\'. This is one of the most sacred places for Vaishnavites. The fourth of the Divya Desams that completes this series is Melukote,—which is known as Thirunarayanapuram. Vaishnavites believe that visiting all four places without a break will guarantee one a place in paramapadam.\nThere is a temple of Varadharajaswamy in Kurmai of Palamaner mandal called the Kurma Varadharaja Swamy Temple and in Yadamari of Yadamari mandal called the Indrapuri Varadharaja Swamy Temple, both in Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh.\nAccording to Hindu legend, Saraswati cursed the king of celestial deities, Indra, to become an elephant and roam around the place. He was relieved of the curse with the divine power of Vishnu, who appeared as the mount, Hastagiri. Hastagiri indicates a mount/hill in the form of elephant. Indra, the king of the devas, is believed to have installed the silver and golden lizards in the temple, who were the witness of the ordeal, after being released from the curse of the goddess Saraswati.[4] Brahma performed a yagna here, the site of which was about to be washed away by the fast flowing river Vegavati (Saraswati in the form of river), known today as the Palar River. The temple deity, Vishnu, laid himself flat to stay the flow and the yagna was successfully performed. Vishnu emerged with brilliance of thousand Suns as Varadharajaswamy inside the athi tree, and stayed here permanently until he was submerged in nearby tank since the deity came from yagna done by Brahma (Historically speaking, his placement may have been due to fear of invasion by the Delhi Sultanate).[4] As is the case with the association of South Indian temples with a sacred tree, a name of the temple, Attigiri, is derived from the atti tree (fig), considered sacred to Vaishnavas as well as other Hindus.[5] There is also stone deity found inside the temple is above the Narasimha shrine. The deity is called Devaraja Perumal, whose worship is equated to the Adi Athi Varadharaja Perumal, that is, two gods residing in one presiding idol.\nAccording to a Hindu legend, Brahma, the Hindu god of creation, separated with his wife Saraswati over a misunderstanding. He performed the ashvamedha sacrifice, seeking boons from Vishnu. Vishnu was pleased by the devotion, and came out from under the earth as a boar, making Saraswati unite with Brahma. Another legend states that the disciples of the sage Gautama were cursed to become lizards. They resided in the temple, and were relieved of the curse by the divine grace of Vishnu. There is a panel in the temple where the two lizards are depicted in the roof of the temple.[6]\nThirukkachi Nambigal (also known as Kanchi Purnar) was an ardent devotee of this temple. He used to bring flowers everyday from Poovirundhavalli, where he maintained a garden. He performed the rituals of the Aalavatta Kaingariyam, waving to produce breeze with the help of a hand fan. It is believed that Vardharaja used to converse with him, while he was performing the ritual.\nNambi also composed the Devarajaashtakam (a Sanskrit poem of 8 verses) for the presiding deity. Ramanuja, an influential Vaishnava preceptor, is regarded to have received answers to his six questions from Varadharaja. through Thirukkachi Nambigal.\nThe temple has around 350 inscriptions from various dynasties like Chola, Pandya, Kandavarayas, Cheras, Kakatiya, Sambuvaraya, Hoysala and Vijayanagara indicating various donations to the temple and also the political situation of Kanchipuram.[7][8] Varadharaja Perumal Temple was renovated by the Cholas in 1053[9] and it was expanded during the reigns of the great Chola kings Kulottunga Chola I and Vikrama Chola. In the 14th century another wall and a gopura was built by the later Chola kings. When a Mughul invasion was expected in 1688, the main image of the deity was sent to Udayarpalayam, now part of Tiruchirappalli district.[10] It was brought back with greater difficulty after the involvement of local preceptor who enlisted the services of general Todarmal.[10] Robert Clive, the British general during the colonial period visited the Garuda seva festival and presented a valuable necklace (now termed Clive Maharkandi), which is adorned during a special occasion every year.[10] At present the administration is carried out by Hindu Religious and Endowment of the Government of Tamil Nadu.[11]\nThe old inscriptions and records of the temple states that several leaders like Vyasatirtha and Satya-Vijaya Tirtha from the Dvaita school of Vedanta had evinced interest in this temple. An epigraph of the temple datable to 1511 CE records that the Dvaita saint and Kulaguru of Krishnadevaraya, Vyasatirtha presented a village and serpant vehicle to Varadharaja Temple and instituted a festival in honour of Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya. Another record dated 1726 CE mentions that another Dvaita saint and Peetadhipathi of Uttaradi Matha by the name Satyavijaya Tirtha was honoured in the temple with some privileges.[12] As Raghava Iyengar mentions in his work Sasana Tamil Kavi Saritham, an inscription at the temple indicates that Parimelalhagar, who wrote his commentary of the Tirukkural around 1271–1272 CE, belonged to the lineage of priests of Ulagalandha Perumal temple.[13]\nThere are inscriptions dated 1532 CE (record 544 of 1919) indicating the gift of number of villages made by Achutaraya.[14] Vira Narasingaraya Saluva Nayaka who was directed by Achutaraya broke the royal order by giving more lands to Ekambaranathar temple than the Varadharaja Swamy temple against the instruction of an equal gift to either of the temples. Achutaraya on hearing this equally distributed the lands to both the temples.[14] There is an inscription from the 13th century from the Hoysalas, indicating a gift of a crown to the presiding deity. During the 17th century, the temple was under the attacks from the Mughals, spearheaded by Aurangzeb. The deities of the temple were ported to Udayarpalayam in modern-day Tiruchirappalli district during 1688. It was only during 1710 that the situation was ripe for the deities to be returned. But the chieftain of Udayarpalayam opposed the move and only after the intervention of Paramahamsa Parivajakacharya Attan Jeer, the deities were returned. The event is commemorated as a festival in the temple.[6]\nThe Thathacharyas are the custodians[15] of the Kanchipuram Perarulalan Kovil popularly known as Varadharaja Perumal temple. They are the Pradhana Acharya Purushas in the protocol to receive and deliver the temple honours. In retrospection Tirumalai Nambi\'s[16] son Tirukkurukai Piran Pillan was ordained by Ramanuja himself as the first and foremost among the 74 Peetadhipathis to propagate Visishtadwaita philosophy after him. Pillan was also chosen by Ramanuja as the competent person to write the commentary on the Tiruvaymoli. The annotation of Tiruvaymoli thus brought out by Pillan[17] under the behest of Ramanuja is called the famous \'Araiyarpadi\' the first gloss in Manipravala, an elegant mixture of Tamil and Sanskrit words, on the Divya Prabhandam.[18] After Pillan, Tirumalai Srinivasacharya Thathacharya in the fifth generation of Thathacharyas was installed by Sri Vedanta Desika as the Sri Kariyam of the Devaraja Swamy Kovil. Since then the office of Sri Kariyam is institutionalised in the diligence and devotion of the Thathacharyas to the Varadharaja Perumal temple in Kanchipuram. Lakshmi Kumara Thathachariar inherited this mantle from his ancestors and made epoch making contributions to the temple annals. He was the Sri Kariya Durandhara – a phrase connoting absolute dedication and authority – of the temple affairs. Simultaneously he was also the Raja Guru of the Vijayanagar king Venkatapathi Deva Maharaj. In Ayengarkulam, a village named after him near Kanchipuram, he built a tank and temple to Sri Rama and Hanuman.\nThe temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu,[19] having the Thathachariars as the Honorary Trustees.\nThe temple is present in Chinna Kanchipuram, a locality in the Eastern side of Kanchipuram, a South Indian town in the state of Tamil Nadu.[20] The temple covers an area of 23.5-acre (95,000 m2), showcasing the architectural skills of ancient Vishwakarma Sthapathis in temple architecture, and is famous for its holiness and ancient history. The temple has three outer precincts (prakarams), namely, Alvar Prakaram, Madai Palli Prakaram and Thiru Malai Prakaram.[21] There are 32 shrines, 19 vimanams (towers), 389 pillared halls (most having the lion type yali sculpture)[22] and sacred tanks some of which located outside the complex.[21][23] The temple tank is called Anantha Theertham.[24] There are 96 ornate sculpted pillars depicting various legends of Mahabharat and Ramayana. The most notable sculptures are of Rati, Manmatha, Lakshmi Narayana, Lakshmi Narasimha, Lakshmi Varaha, and Lakshmi Hayagreeva.[25]\nThe main sanctum faces west and can be entered through a 130-feet-tall, 7-tiered rajagopuram (main gateway tower).[4] The image of the presiding deity is designed in such a way that on the 15th day after Chitra Purnima, the rays of the Sun fall on the idol.[26] The hill, called Hastagiri, is 360 m (1,180 ft) long by 240 metres (790 ft).[27] The eastern gopuram is taller than the western gopuram, which is contrasting to large temples where the rajagopuram is the tallest one.[4] One of the most famous architectural pieces in the temple is the huge stone chain sculpted in a single stone.[28] There is a 100 pillared hall[29] which has sculptures depicting Ramayana and Mahabharata. It is a masterpiece of Vijayanagara architecture.[21][28]\nHastagiri has murals of the late Vijayanagara empire on the ceiling.[21] Another significant features of the temple are beautifully carved lizards and gilded with gold, over the sanctum.[28][30] The vimana over the sanctum of Varadharaja Swami is called Punyakoti Vimanam and the one over Perundevi Thayar shrine is called Kalyana Koti Vimanam.[4]\nApart from the main stone idol, the temple has the wooden image of Varadharajaswamy made of Atthi or the fig tree and preserved under water in a secret chamber. It is brought out for worship once every 40 years.[31] The festivities last 48 days after which it is immersed in the water and stored for the next 40 years. It is believed that there is a heavy downpour after the idol is immersed to fill the tank. The presiding deity is a 10 ft (3.0 m) tall idol made of granite in standing posture, while Thayar is a 4 ft (1.2 m) image in sitting posture.[6] There is a shrine of Narasimha on the hillock.[21] The origin of the mask of Narasimha is mysterious and believed to possess inexplicable powers.[32]\nIn the second precinct downstairs contains four shrines, of which the important one is of Malayala Nachiar (Kerala consort), presumably built during the Chera kings in the early 14th century.[21] There are images of Alvars and Ramanuja in the second precinct.[27]\nThe third precinct has the shrine of Goddess Perundevi Thayar; it is customary for devotees to visit the shrine first before visiting the main Perumal shrine.[10] There are four small pillared halls, identical in structure, called Thulabara Mandapas built during the 1532 for a ceremony of Achyutaraya of the Vijayanagara Empire.[10]\nThe seven precincts are called Pradakshina Padha, Hastagiri Pradakshana, Madapalli Pragara, Alavandar Pragara, and Alvar Thiruveedhi. The Alavandar Pragara houses lot of shrines of the temple. The temple has two towers on the eastern and western sides, which are 180 ft (55 m) and 160 ft (49 m) tall respectively. There is a hundred pillared hall, which has ornate carvings, notable of which being a stone chain. The temple car is believed to have been donated by Krishnadevaraya in 1517 CE. There are paintings in the temple commissioned during the 16th century during the rule of Vijayanagara kings.[6]\nThere is a shrine of Chakratalvar on the eastern side of the temple tank. The image of Chakratalvar (Sudarshana) in the temple is depicted with six hands. There festival image of the temple has seven different images of Sudarshana depicted within the same chakra. There are two entrances to the shrine as the two images are considered to be separate. The shrine is believed to have been constructed during the time of Kulothunga III during 1191 CE by Ilavalagan Kalingarayan of Nettur as seen from the inscriptions in the temple. The later additions are presumably made by the Vijayanagara Empire during the 13th or early part of 14th century. The kings also added pillared columns in the leading hall sculpted with figures from Ramayana and various forms of Vishnu.[33]\nThe temple is often mentioned as the divine source of Sri Vaishnava literature. Thirumangai Alvar spent all his wealth and taxes towards the building of the temple and the king punished him for not paying the taxes, and losing wealth of the kingdom. A divine voice informed the king in his dreams that he can pickup wealth from a nearby place and relieve Thirumangai Alvar. Thirukachi Nambi was an ardent devotee of Varadharaja. He used to come a long way everyday to the temple to offer his worship. During his old age, he was privileged to converse with god. Ramanuja, the preceptor of Vishishtadvaita philosophy, was tricked by his master and was plotted to be killed. But by the grace of divinity, he was masked as a hunter and escape the event. He later came back to the temple to the making of the Vaishnava philosophy.[6]\nVedanta Desika, the revered polymath next only to Ramanuja mentions the annual ten-day festival celebrated in May.[10] In one of the verses, he extols the deity:\nThe temple also finds mention in the Thirtha Prabandha, a travelogue with descriptions of pilgrim centers throughout India written by Sri Vadiraja Swamy.\nTyagaraja and Muthuswami Dikshitar, the celebrated composers of the 18th century created compositions on the festival.[10] Thirumangai Alvar wrote four pasurams (hymns), Bhoothathalvar wrote two, and Peyalvar penned one.\nSri Alluri Venkatadri Swamigal composed more than 200 keerthanams about Varadharaja Perumal.\nThe temple is famous for its huge umbrella used during festive occasions. During the bhramotsavam (major festival) in Vaigasi (May/June), thousands of people throng the temple and that increases twofold during the Garuda Vahanam and the Ther Thiruvila, the chariot procession.[citation needed]\nAtthi Varadharaja Perumal (Atthi Varadar), the 10-feet deity image, is made of the Atthi or the fig tree, and is stored in an underground chamber inside the temple tank which is called the Anantha Sarovaram/ Anantha Saras. It is brought out to worship for 48 days after every 40 years.[35][36] It is worshipped in the Vasantha Mantapam, which located in the south-west corner of the temple. The Aththi Varadar is worshipped in sleeping posture (Kidantha Thirukkolam or Sayana Kolam) in the first 24 days, followed by standing position (Nindra Thirukkolam) in the next 24 days.[37]\nThe icon, which was the presiding deity earlier, was hidden in the 16th century to protect from invaders; however replaced by the current stone central icon when the wooden icon could not be traced. In 1709, the icon was accidentally rediscovered when the temple tank was emptied; thereafter the tradition of worshipping the deity once in 40 years was established.[38]\nThe festival was last held from 1 July to 17 Aug in 2019. The next Atthi Varadar festival will be held in 2059.\nEarlier documented dates about the rise are:', 'images/SRI VARADARAJA PERUMAL TEMPLE/440px-Tamil_saint_64679.jpg', 'RP9F+PWJ, W Mada St, Nethaji Nagar, Kanchipuram, Nattapettai, Tamil Nadu 631501, India', 12.819335, 79.724771, 'Monday\n0600–1230\n\nMonday\n1530–2030\n\nTuesday\n0600–1230\n\nTuesday\n1530–2030\n\nWednesday\n0600–1230\n\nWednesday\n1530–2030\n\nThursday\n0600–1230\n\nThursday\n1530–2030\n\nFriday\n0600–1230\n\nFriday\n1530–2030\n\nSaturday\n0600–1230\n\nSaturday\n1530–2030\n\nSunday\n0600–1230\n\nSunda', 'To Be Implemented', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varadharaja_Perumal_Temple,_Kanchipuram', 'Phone number not available ,International phone number not available', 'Email not available');

(3, 2, 'Adi Kesava Temple is dedicated to Hindu god Vishnu located in Mylapore, Chennai, in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Constructed in the Tamil style of architecture, dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Adi Kesava Perumal and his consort Lakshmi as Mayuravalli Thayar. The temple is believed to be the birthplace of Peyalvar, an Alvar saint. It is considered one among the 108 Abhimana Kshethram of Vaishnavate tradition.\nChithra Kulam, the temple tank is believed to be of historic origin and one of the major rainwater storage facility in the region. The float festival celebrated during the Tamil month of Thai is a very prominent festival of the temple. The temple is open from 5 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m and has six daily rituals at various times of the day. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Endowment Board of the Government of Tamil Nadu.\nAs per Hindu legend, during the churning of the Ocean of milk, Vishnu instructed his consort Lakshmi to reach the hermitage of Sage Bhrigu. The sage was doing a penance to attain a girl child, and accepted Lakshmi as his daughter. The presiding deity, Adi Kesava, is believed to have married goddess Bhargavi, the daughter of sage Bhrigu.[1]\nThe temple is believed to be the birthplace of Peyalvar, one of the twelve Alvar saints of the 6th-9th century CE. The Alvar was found from the 60 ft (18 m) well called Manikairavam inside the temple premises.[2]\nThe temple is built in Tamil architecture occupies around 1.5 acres (0.61 ha) and has two precincts. It is located in Mylapore, in Chennai, the capital of the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The temple has a rectangular plan surrounded by 10 ft (3.0 m) high walls, with a 5-tier gopuram, the gateway tower. The presiding deity is housed in the sanctum and is an image made of granite. The deity is seen in standing posture. The shrine of Garuda faces Adi Kesava, the eagle mount (Vahana) of Vishnu. The central shrine is approached through a worship hall and a narrow Ardha Mandapam. The flagpost (\"Dhwaja sthambam\") is located behind the shrine of Garuda. There are images of Alvars in the worship hall on both sides and the shrine of Mayuravalli is located on the western side of the temple in the second precinct.[3] In modern times, the temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu.[4]\nIn modern times, the temple tank as a store house for rain water harvesting for the nearby areas.[5] The temple tank is believed to be 4,000 years old and was desilted for the first time in 2016. The float festival in the temple was celebrated from 2005 and 2016 and was not celebrated later due to dry tank due to clogging of the canals leading to the tank.[6]\nThe temple is open from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. The temple priests perform the puja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. As at other Vishnu temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Vaishnavaite community. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Ushathkalam at 8 a.m., Kalasanthi at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m. and Ardha Jamam at 7:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethyam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Adi Kesava Perumal and his consort Mayuravalli Thayar. During the worship, religious instructions in the Vedas (sacred text) are recited by priests, and worshippers prostrate themselves in front of the temple mast. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple.\nThe temple procession takes place during the ekadasi day, Tiruvonam, the occasions of the full moon and the new moon, when the festival images (utsavar) of  Adi Kesava, Sridevi, and Bhudevi are taken in a procession. There are different processions taken by Mayuravalli Thaayaar on Fridays and Uthiram star, Andal on the Pooram star, Rama on Punarpoosam,  and the Alvars, on their birthdays.  Brahmotsavam, the main festival of the temple is performed during the Tamil month of Panguni.  During the ten-day festival, the twelve Alvars and the twenty-one Vaishnava Acharyas are taken in procession along with Adi Kesava perumaaL. During the Tamil month of Aadi, float festival (theppothsavam) is conducted for five days.[1][7]\nThe goddess Mayuravalli is worshipped with Bilva leaves, which are otherwise used only in Shiva temples. Shiva, Parvati, and Lakshmi in the form of Mayuravalli are believed to have worshipped Adi Kesava Perumal and got relieved off their curses. It is believed that Pey Alvar was taught by Mayuravalli. Following the legend of the temple, the temple is frequented by devotees praying for their education and also for getting a good married life.[8] The temple and Kapaleeshwarar Temple are the oldest extant monuments in Mylapore.[9]\nMadhava Perumal Temple, Mylapore', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adikesava_Perumal_temple,_Mylapore'),

According to legend, the Pandavas after having won over the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war, felt guilty of having killed their own Kith and Kin and sought blessings of Lord Shiva for redemption. He eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bafellow.\nOn being followed, the Lord dived into the ground, leaving his hump on the surface at Kedarnath. The remaining portions of Lord Shiva appeared at four other places and are worshipped there as his manifestations.

On being followed by the Pandavas, he dived into ground at the exact place where the Holy Sanctum is now present, leaving behind his hump on the floor surface, which is now visible. This Hump inside the temple is in the form of a conical rock formation and is worshipped as Lord Shiva manifested in his Sadashiva form. The Pujas and Archanas are performed on this manifestation by priests and piligrims. There is also a Holy Statue of Lod Shiva inside the temple, which is the portable manifestation (Utsavar) of the Lord.\nOutside the temple door, a large statue of Nandi bafellow stands as guard.

After this, wondering at the beauty, the king married the woman and she \nbecame the queen of the place. On hearing the secret of an old lady becoming a beautiful woman, he was in an eager mood to meet Thirumizhisai Alwar.\n\n\nKani Kannan, who was great follower of Thirumazhisai Alwar, helped and followed him and his teachings. The king called up Kani Kannan and asked that Thirumizhisai Alwar should come to his palace and\nshould sing a poem on praising him. On hearing this, Kani Kannan said that all the poems and \nsongs that comes from the mouth of Thirumizhisai Alwar belongs to Srivaikundanathan and it is \nimpossible for him to come to the palace and sung a poem on praising the king.\n\n\nOn hearing this, he showed lots of gold ornaments, silver items, Diamonds etc to Kani Kannan\nand since he being very close to Thirumizhisai Alwar, atleast he could sing a poem on praising \nhim. But, Kani Kannan refused to do so and said he will not sing any song on praising the \nhumans. The King got angry on hearing this and ordered him to get out from Kanchi at once.\n\n\nKani Kannan went to Thirumizhisai Alwar and explained all about that had happened in the palace and prepared to start getting out from Kanchipuram. On seeing this, Thirumizhisai Alwar also prepred to start from Kanchi leaving along with Kani Kannan. So, he too started along with him. While they were going, he sung a song on the Yadhothakari Perumal as Kani Kannan is leaving Kanchipuram, he is also going along with him and Alwar asks the Perumal to get up from his Aadhisheshan, which is the bed for him and roll it and wants him to quit from Kanchi.\n\n\nThe Perumal also got out from Kanchipuram following the Alwar and Kani Kannan. On hearing this, the king and all the people of Kanchi, begged Kani Kannan to return back to Kanchipuram.\n\n\nAnd after this, Kani Kannan along with Thirumizhisai Alwar came back to Kanchipuram. When\nreturning, Alwar sung a song asking that Kani Kannan has returned back to Kanchi and he want the Perumal to go and sleep in his Aadhiseshan in the temple. On hearing this, Sriman Narayanan comes back to Thiruvekka temple and gives his sayana kols seva. Since the Perumal obeyed the words of Thirumizhisai Alwar and did what he said, he is called as \"Sonna Vannam seitha perumal\". Sonna vannam seitha means obeying and doing the \nsame what was told to him. This is one of the purana story said about this sthalam.\n\n\nOnce in Brahma logam, there was an arguement that who is greater between Naa Magal (or) Saraswathi and Poo Magal (Sri Lakshmi). Brahma said that it is Poomagal  - Lakshmi Thaayar who is found on the heart of Sri Vishnu is the greatest. Next, Saraswathi asked which river is the big river. But, unfortunately Brahma answered that the greatest river is River Ganga which is originating from the feet of Sri Vishnu is the greates. On hearing this, Saraswathi got angry and quit from the disappeared and went along the banks of river Ganga and started doing Tapas.\n\n\n\nNaan mughan, Brahma wanted to do the great Ashwametha Yagam in Kanchipuram and wanted Saraswathi to be along with him. So, he sent his son Vashistan to make Saraswathi come back to him. But, Saraswathi refused to come along with him. After this, Brahma devan started the Yagam keeping Savithri and all of his wives with him. \n\n\nOn seeing this, the Asuraas (the Demon) wanted to destroy the Yagam and went to Saraswathi\nand made her angry by telling her what is happening. She got angry on Brahma devan and started as \"Vegavathi\" river along the south direction and flow across the place of the Yagam to destroy it . But, Sriman Narayanan wanted to stop Vegavadhi river and protect the Yagam from her. So, he stoped the river by lying across the river on Aadhiseshan. \nBecause of this, this perumal is also named as \"Vaga Sethu\".\n\n\nThis Vega Sethu then became Vegavanai and then finally named as \"Vekkanai\" and finally became\n\"Vekka\".\n\n\nIn this sthalam only, Manavala Maamunigal expalined his \"Sri Bashyam\" to the world.\n\n\n\nSpecials:\n\nIn the Pushkarani of this temple only, Poigai Alwar was born.\n\n\nMoolavar and Thaayar:\n\n\nThe Moolavar of this sthalam is Sri Yathothakaari.

The temple has a five-tiered rajagopuram, the temple\'s gateway tower. The temple is originally believed to have been built by the Cholas during the 11th century, with later expansion from the Pandyas.\nThe temple follows Vaikasana Agama tradition of worship. Four daily rituals and three yearly festivals are held at the temple, of which the ten-day annual Brahmostavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) and five-day Pavitrotsavam during Avani (August - September) and 25-day Ramar festival during chittirai being the most prominent. The temple is maintained and administered by the Archaeological Survey of India as a protected monument.\nThe temple is originally believed to be built by the later Cholas and subsequently by the Pandyas from the 12th century. The regions changed hands from British to French colonial Empire during the 17th century. Most temples in the place were destroyed during the French invasion, but the temple was spared.[1][2] The temple housed the images of the Vedapureeswarar Temple during the destruction by the French troops during 1748. The temple was also guarded from the invading Muslim troops. The images of Rama, Sita, Hanuman, Navaneethakrishnan, Santhanakrishnan and Venugopalan were dug out from Vaithikupam in 1902 and subsequently housed in the temple. It is believed that Vasantha Mandapam was built by a Muslim.[1]\nThe five-tiered rajagopuram, the temple\'s gateway tower, is 110 ft (34 m) tall. The sanctum houses the image of Varadaraja Perumal in standing posture 5 ft (1.5 m) is made of granite sporting four arms. Two of his arms hold the conch and Chakra, while the other two sport Abayamudra and Kadahasta. The images of Sridevi and Bhudevi are located on either of his sides. The festive image is called Srinivasan and the image has identical features as that of the presiding deity. The Ardha mandapa is guarded by two Dwarapalas on either sides. There is a separate shrine of Perundevi in the second precinct, which also houses the festival image. There is a mirror hall in the temple adjacent to the sanctum. There are paintings done in modern days around the walls of the precinct showing the 108 Divya Desams. There are separate shrines for Vaishana Gurus like Nikamanda Mahadesikan and Manavalamamunigal. The temple has 83 springs in the temple tanks and 12 bodies of water. The water in the temple tank is considered to be medicinal and devotees take a dip to cure themselves of common ailments.[1]\nThe temple does not differentiate between Thenkalai and Vadakalai sects of Vaishnavite tradition and follows Pancharathra aagama. In modern times, the temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. The temple rituals are performed four times a day: Kalasanthi at 8:00 a.m., Uchikalam at 12:00 p.m., Sayarakshai at 5:00 p.m., and Sayarakshai at 8:00 p.m. Each ritual has three steps: alangaram (decoration), neivethanam (food offering) and deepa aradanai (waving of lamps) for both Varadaraja Perumal and Perundevi. There are weekly, monthly and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The major festivals in the temple are the ten day annual Brahmostavam during the Tamil month of Chittirai (April - May) and five day Pavitrotsavam during Avani (August - September) and 25 day Ramar festival during chittirai.[1] During the Ramanavami festival, the festive images of Rama, Sita, Lakshmana and Hanuman are taken around the streets of the temple in the temple chariot drawn by thousands of devotees.\nAnnaprasanam, a practise of making the infants write their first alphabet in a plate of rice, is a ritual practised in the temple by devotees. The temple is maintained and administered by the Government of Puducherry[3] The temple is the Abimana temple of Devanathaswamy temple in Thiruvanthipuram.[4]', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varadharaja_Perumal_Temple,_Puducherry'),

Legend says that the temple was initially built in the honor of Lord Rama and his family, whose statues were being brought to the temple from the sea.
